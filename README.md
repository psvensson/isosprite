# isosprite
A Smalltalk project for managing and displaying isometric sprites

Written in Pharo but uses Morphic and should hopefully work in other smalltalk, let me know if not.
Graphics and sprites ise mostly (c) but CC by Clint Bellanger and from OpenGameart; https://opengameart.org/content/cave-tileset

Run the IsoSpriteBoardTest which acts as just an example and opens an IsoSpriteBoard in world.
